@CLAUDE.md Build a documentation of the files that jarvis generates, the paths it expects, and how to query the paths. We should add a command for querying the set of paths that jarvis produces, including the configuration file, repo file, env files, and pipeline files. 


# Jarvis directories
```
jarvis path +shared +priv +conf
```

A command that should print 

# Jarvis 

# C
